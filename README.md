# ðŸ›¸ Drone Simulation with ArduPilot, MAVProxy, and Gazebo Harmonic

This repository contains the files and documentation for setting up a drone simulation environment using **ArduPilot SITL**, **MAVProxy**, **Gazebo Harmonic**, and **QGroundControl**. The simulation includes basic drone flight and waypoint navigation using QGroundControl.

## ðŸ“– What This Repo Is About

This project demonstrates:
- Installing and running **ArduPilot SITL (Software-In-The-Loop)** for drone simulation
- Bridging with **MAVProxy** and **Gazebo Harmonic** for visual simulation
- Connecting to **QGroundControl** for mission planning and control
- Running basic waypoint navigation using QGroundControl + ArduPilot SITL
